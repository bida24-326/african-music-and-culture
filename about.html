      <h3>🌍 Why African Music?</h3>
      <p>
        African music is one of the richest forms of cultural expression in the world. It blends drums,
        vocals, movement, and tradition into a living, breathing art form. The goal of this site is to
        celebrate that beauty and introduce it to anyone curious enough to listen.
