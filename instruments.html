    <h2>Traditional African Instruments</h2>
    <p>
      African instruments are not just for music — they carry emotion, tell stories, and connect generations.
      Let’s look at a few iconic ones that bring the beat to life.

      <h3>🪘 Djembe</h3>
      <p>
        Originating from West Africa, the Djembe is a goblet-shaped drum played with bare hands. It’s used in
        celebrations, storytelling, and even healing rituals. The rhythms speak louder than words.

    </div>

    <div class="feature slide-in delay-2">
      <h3>🎼 Kora</h3>
      <p>
        A beautiful harp-lute with 21 strings, the Kora is played across Mali, Senegal, and Gambia. Its music is
        graceful and complex, often used by griots (oral historians) to share family and royal histories.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature slide-in delay-3">
      <h3>🪈 Mbira</h3>
      <p>
        Also called the “thumb piano,” the Mbira is from Zimbabwe and has metal keys plucked to produce
        a peaceful, echoing melody. It’s used in ceremonies and spiritual rituals.
